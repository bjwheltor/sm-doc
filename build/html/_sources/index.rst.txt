Introduction
------------

Shifting Maze is a game where the player attempts to navigate a finite, 
2D array of rooms, each having between 0 and 3 walls (or between 1 and 
4 doorways). As well as moving between the rooms through the doorways, 
the player can also rotate the current room they are in, opening up new
possiblities for navigation through the 'maze'.
